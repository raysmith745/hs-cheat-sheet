# Hearthstone Cheat Sheet

The Hearthstone Cheat Sheet is intended to be a resource to help newer players get better at Hearthstone.

Initially it will be a simple list of all AoEs, direct damage cards and important spells to beware of at specific mana costs.

In future, the hope is to expand it to include dropdowns, toggles etc, with more customisation and a nicer UI.
